Aether Guild | Global Atlas & Research Archive

The Aether Atlas is a high-performance Geospatial Information System (GIS) integrated with a Peer-Reviewed Semantic Wiki. Designed for the Aether Guild, this platform aggregates global paranormal and spiritual phenomena into a laboratory-grade database, moving beyond anecdotal accounts into data-driven analysis of manifestation mechanics and universal laws.

1. Core Vision

To provide a clinical, transparent, and scientifically rigorous platform for the documentation of unexplained phenomena. The Atlas balances public data accessibility with strict ethical protocols for sensitive cultural and regional taboos.

2. Platform Features

A. Integrated Wiki-Map UI

Geospatial Intelligence: A full-screen, high-performance map using Leaflet.js for real-time tracking of manifestations.

Taxonomy Linking: Phenomena are categorized by manifestation form (e.g., Class I Residual, Class III Apparition) and linked directly to deep research papers in the Archive.

Clinical Interface: A high-contrast "Tactical" UI optimized for field use, featuring deep-space backgrounds and "Ion" cyan data visualization.

B. Scientific Observation Protocol

Automated Metadata: The system is designed to capture environmental variables at the moment of submission, including moon phases, barometric pressure, and solar activity (KP-Index).

Sensor Logging: Manual entry support for EMF (mG), temperature (Celsius), and ambient noise (dB) to build a multi-modal evidence profile.

C. Trust & Ethics (The Black Box)

Privacy Protocols: Zero-knowledge encryption for private user pins.

Closed Phenomena Logic: Restricted access for sensitive cultural manifestations (e.g., specific indigenous taboos) to protect local traditions and investigator safety.

Badge System: Verification tiers including "Guild Certified," "Science-Backed," and "Historical/Legal" records.

D. Investigator Ranking

A reputation-based hierarchy from Rank 0 (Witness) to Rank 4 (Guild Master), governing data access, editing permissions, and vault entry.

3. Technical Stack

Frontend: HTML5, Tailwind CSS, Space Grotesk Typography.

Mapping: Leaflet.js with Dark-Matter tiles.

Backend: Firebase (Firestore for real-time data, Firebase Auth for secure logging).

CI/CD: Automated deployment to Firebase Hosting via GitHub Actions.

4. Setup & Deployment

Repository: Clone the repository to your local machine.

Firebase Configuration: Initialize the Firebase CLI and link your project.

Environmental Keys: Ensure your firebaseConfig object is populated in the index.html file.

Broadcast: Push changes to the main branch to trigger the automated deployment workflow.
